# Adaptive based traffic control system simulation
## Introduction
An adaptive traffic control system to be developed during KU hackfest 2022. Here in this project, we have developed simulation of the road traffic in crossroads from scratch and tried to depict the problems that can occur due to traffic congestion. Here, we propose an adaptive traffic control system that controls the time of traffic lights based on the traffic present in the road. Although, we planned to incorporate AI to perform adaptive traffic control we were unable to incorporate AI due to lack of time and research. So currently, we have implemented a basic adaptive traffic light control system and tried to compare performance of adaptive system to a normal traffic light system present in crossroads by visualizing the road traffic.

## The Problem it solves
This system is a simple simulation of road traffic in crossroads. Our system aims to simulate an adaptive traffic control system that will automatically change the duration of the traffic light based on the traffic condition in a road. Here the system will change the time based on the count of vehicles present on a road. If a road has higher number of vehicles, the green light will be shown for more time and if road has very few vehicles, the green light will be shown for less time. In this system, we have simulated the road traffic and visualized traffic problems that may occur in crossroads.

## Challenges we ran into:
Some challenges we faced when developing this system are :
1. We had ideas to implement various features in this system and to incorporate AI in this system but due to lack of time, we couldn't do proper research and develop the system completely.
2. We also spent a lot of time debugging due to merge conflicts in our repository.
3. We didn't have proper experience with pygame before so implementing our ideas properly was difficult.
4. We couldn't develop proper assets for vehicles and background due to less time.
